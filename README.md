# Panthera_Infotech_Market_Intel_Dashboard
This project involves building an end-to-end automated reporting system for real estate market analysis in the USA. Automation is achieved by using Python scripts for monthly data scraping, which are hosted on AWS EC2 to reduce uptime costs. The data is parsed, validated, and then appended to a master dataset for cumulative analysis. A 12-page interactive Power BI dashboard was created, featuring over 50 metrics and visualizations that cover pricing trends, sales volume, and location-based comparisons. This system enables stakeholders to easily track market movements, builder-wise performance, and identify seasonal and regional trends. The user experience is prioritized through a clean interface with filters, tooltips, and responsive visuals, enhancing usability and decision-making.        4o mini
